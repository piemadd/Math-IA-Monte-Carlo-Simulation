In this foler, you will find the plots exported from the program.
These are saved as plot.png. Therefore, it is important that you 
change the name of the most recently generated file to avoid anything
being overwritten.

UPDATE: Files are written into the main directory as they weren't 
        saving when i sent them to this folder??? IDK, stuff breaks
        sometimes...
